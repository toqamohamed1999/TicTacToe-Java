and then gets to pick his avatar and type in his name!
 
and then the user can move to the game board playing against the computer
 
or we can choose to play in multiplayer mode which has to options either local or online
 
if the user chooses local both players can pick their avatars and type in thier names
 
and here is the avatar choice panels that appears to both players
 
and now the players are ready to move to the game screen
 
and finally online mode
first the user needs to either signin or signup
  
and then we move to a list showing all online players available for the user to pick a person to play against
 
once the user chooses an opponent an invitation is sent to the opponent where he gets to either accept or decline
 
once the other player accepts they both move to the game board
 
once we have a winner we show 2 screens one to the winner and another one to the loser
  
or maybe it could end with a draw as well
 
and finally we have the last screen in our app which is the profile app
